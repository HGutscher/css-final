        <h2>Promises and History</h2>
        <p>
          The 23 of July, 1874 was the offical date of the Approvment of
          <span>Treaty 4</span>. It was signed between the crown, the Cree,
          Sautleaux bands of the Ojibwa, and the Assiniboine. The nations agreed
          to essentially the same terms as <span>Treaty Number 3</span>. Each
          person was to receive an annual payment of $5 and a gift of clothing,
          chiefs were to receive $25 annually and a one time payment of $25, a
          coat, and a silver medal. Every third year, chiefs and band leaders
          were to receive new clothing. Four leaders per band were also to
          receive $15 yearly. Every family of five would get one square mile of
          land, which they could sell back to the government for compensation.
          The treaty also provided farming tools, reserves, ammunition, and
          schools. <span>Treaty 4</span> also gave guaranteed rights to hunt,
          fish, and trap all upon ceded land unless land was to be used for
          forestry, mining, agriculture, or settlement.
